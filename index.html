# Versioning (like a designer)
![](designer_versionning.png)
- confusing naming (wich is the last ?)
- no remote backup

---

# Versioning (like a pro)

As developper we need versioning because:

- It keep a trace of every file changes, so you can
  - See what/who changed what line and why
  - Undo the changes
  - Reorder the changes
  - Clean your code !
- Work offline
- Allow multiple user to collaborate
- You want to backup on a remote server

---

#### Concurrent Versions System (CVS):
- Created in 86 released in 1990 (dead since 10 years)
- Base for all the rests

#### Subversion (SVN):
- released in 2000
- try to be CVS compatible and fix bug and add missing features
- Not good with file renaming and is centralized

#### Git:
- Linux Kernel was versionnized under **BitKeeper**, a paying proprietary solution with a free licence to Linux community,
as long as they do not try to understand how BitKeeper work ... wich, of course, appened.
In 2005 the license was revoked and Linus had no choice but to stop working on the Linux kernel and create a new software because he was not happy with CVS & SVN.
- Decentralised architecture

#### Mercurial (Hg):
- Created around the same time as Git (205), with the same goal (to host the Linux kernel) for the same reason (replace bitkeeper)
- Slightly easyer to use than git

# Now let's start

## `mkdir myproject && cd myproject`
Yes, this is an island in the sea, trust me

---
class:bg
background-image: url(2.png)
## `git init`

There is a new directory `.git` = the guy watching your island

---
class:bg
background-image: url(2.png)
## `git status`
Use this command to know the status of your git, very usefull.

`On branch master` : this is the **default** name of your deck, we'll need it later

---
class:bg
background-image: url(3.png)
## `touch tree`
We will create a file named `tree`

---
class:bg
background-image: url(4.png)
## `git stage tree`  or `git add tree`
This will copy the file `tree` in the staging area

---
class:bg
background-image: url(5.png)
## `git commit -m 'Tree Added' `
This close the box with a message on it (more detail later)
---
class:bg
background-image: url(6.png)
## The stage is now free again

---
class:bg
background-image: url(7.png)
## `touch wall`

---
class:bg
background-image: url(8.png)
## `git add wall`

---
class:bg
background-image: url(8-2.png)
## `git commit -m 'to finish' `

---
class:bg
background-image: url(9.png)
## The stage is now free again

---
class:bg
background-image: url(10.png)
## Find a free Git Hosting
- Github by Microsoft
- Gitlab by GitLab Inc.
- BitBucket by Atlassian
- Your Home/University/Entreprise git server

### `git remote add github github.com/me/house`
This will explain to git where to push the code.

---
class:bg
background-image: url(12.png)
### we can now send the code on the cloud

---
class:bg
background-image: url(13.png)
## `git push github master`
Upload to the server named "github", the content of our deck (did you remember the name ?)

---
class:bg
background-image: url(14.png)
## Let's say something `rm *` your project
Your `.git` filder is still here (`*` does not delete hidden files)
---
class:bg
background-image: url(13.png)
## We can rebuild using our boxes !
## `git reset --hard`
The `--hard` part is to confirm that you are ready to lose what's on your island (nothing)
---
class:bg
background-image: url(15.png)
Now let say that everything has been deleted (including the `.git`)
## `rm * && rm .git`

---
class:bg
background-image: url(16.png)
## We can still fetch from the cloud !
## `git clone github.com/me/house .`
So remember to push your file everyday, or you will regret it ... trust me

---
background-image: url(git.commit.png)

---
### What we saw
- `git init` = initialize git on the project
- `git add/stage` = add a modification to the staging area
- `git commit` = seal the staging area into a box
- `git remote` = remote server to upload the code
- `git push` = send the boxes to the cloud
- `git clone` = retreive your project from cloud
- `git reset --hard` = replace your file with the last commit
- `git status` = tell you what changed, what is wrong...

# Git advanced
In the following part we will see the most complex part of git
- How commit work
- What is a branch and why use them

- `git branch` Create a branch
- `git checkout` move between branches
- `git tag`
- `git cherry-pick`
- `git blame`
- `git config`
- `git apply`
- `git diff`
- `git fetch`
- `git merge / request-pull`
- `git rebase`
- `git revert`
- `git stash`
- `git submodule`
- `tig` / `git log / shortlog / whatchanged`

---
# `git commit`
- You give a message (`-m`) to explain what's inside
- Git will add the previous ID
- the **changes** from the previous commit
- Git will generate a unique ID based on all the above data
- if one of the prvious data change, the generated ID will change too !

---
# `git branch`
when 2 commit have the same parent = it's a new branch
Branch naming is important "stable" "unstable" "dev-refactor"

`git checkout -b unstable`

---
# `git rebase`
Let's say you commited a password in a box
You open back a box, change it, close it, re-stamp it => it ID changed ! (now think about the children)
- you boxed a sensible information
- interactiv mode
- ammend
- squash

---
# `git log --graph --oneline --all` or `tig`
Show you the complete graph of your commits

very usefull when you are lost

---
# `git blame`
![](git.blame.jpg)

---
# `git revert`

---
# `git merge`
Someone also work on your project and want to give it changes to you
