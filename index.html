# Versioning (like a designer)
![](designer_versionning.png)
- confusing naming (wich is the last ?)
- no remote backup

---

# Versioning (like a pro)

As developper we need versioning because:

- It keep a trace of every file changes, so you can
  - See what/who changed what line and why
  - Undo the changes
  - Reorder the changes
  - Clean your code !
- Work offline
- Allow multiple user to collaborate
- You want to backup on a remote server

---

# Major Version Control Systems

## Mid tier:
- CVS : created in the 80's
- SVN : try to fix CVS
## Good tier:
- Mercurial : very similar to git
- Git : Powerfull versioning tool, but hard to learn.

I'll make it visual (thank to my painting skills) so it's easy to remeber

# History of git

Created by .half[![](torvalds.jpg)] for his small project .half[![](linux.png)] because other Versioning Tools (CVS, SVN) wasn't good enough for him.

### Trivia:

Linux was using **BitKeeper**, a proprietary solution wths a free licence to linux if they do not try to re-code it (wich appened). So the license was revoked and linus had no choice but to stop linux and make a new software quickly.

# Now let's start

## `mkdir myproject && cd myproject`
Yes, this is an island in the sea, trust me

---
class:bg
background-image: url(2.png)
## `git init`

There is a new directory `.git` = the guy watching your island

---
class:bg
background-image: url(2.png)
## `git status`
Use this command to know the status of your git, very usefull.

`On branch master` : this is the **default** name of your deck, we'll need it later

---
class:bg
background-image: url(3.png)
## `touch tree`
We will create a file named `tree`

---
class:bg
background-image: url(4.png)
## `git stage tree`  or `git add tree`
This will copy the file `tree` in the staging area

---
class:bg
background-image: url(5.png)
## `git commit -m 'Tree Added' `
This close the box with a message on it (more detail later)
---
class:bg
background-image: url(6.png)
## The stage is now free again

---
class:bg
background-image: url(7.png)
## `touch wall`

---
class:bg
background-image: url(8.png)
## `git add wall`

---
class:bg
background-image: url(8-2.png)
## `git commit -m 'to finish' `

---
class:bg
background-image: url(9.png)
## The stage is now free again

background-image: url(10.png)
## Find a free Git Hosting
- Github by Microsoft
- Gitlab by GitLab Inc.
- BitBucket by Atlassian
- Your Home/University/Entreprise git server

### `git remote add github github.com/me/house`
This will explain to git where to push the code.

---
class:bg
background-image: url(12.png)
### we can now send the code on the cloud

---
class:bg
background-image: url(13.png)
## `git push github master`
Upload to the server named "github", the content of our deck (did you remember the name ?)

---
class:bg
background-image: url(14.png)
## Let's say something `rm *` your project
Your `.git` filder is still here (`*` does not delete hidden files)
---
class:bg
background-image: url(13.png)
## We can rebuild using our boxes !
## `git reset --hard`
The `--hard` part is to confirm that you are ready to lose what's on your island (nothing)
---
class:bg
background-image: url(15.png)
Now let say that everything has been deleted (including the `.git`)
## `rm * && rm .git`

---
class:bg
background-image: url(16.png)
## We can still fetch from the cloud !
## `git clone github.com/me/house .`
So remember to push your file everyday, or you will regret it ... trust me

---

# Let's recap
- `git init` = initialize git on the project
- `git add/stage` = add a modification to the staging area
- `git commit` = seal the staging area into a box
- `git push` = send the boxes to the cloud
- `git clone` = retreive your project from cloud
- `git remote` = remote server to upload the code
- `git reset --hard` = replace your file with the last commit
- `git status` = tell you what changed, what is wrong...

---
# Git advanced
In the following part we will see the most complex part of git

---
# `git commit`
- You give a message (`-m`) to explain what's inside
- Git will add the previous ID
- the **changes** from the previous commit
- Git will generate a unique ID based on all the above data
- if one of the prvious data change, the generated ID will change too !

---
# `git branch`
when 2 commit have the same parent = it's a new branch
Branch naming is important "stable" "unstable" "dev-refactor"
`git checkout -b unstable`

---
# `git rebase`
Let's say you commited a password in a box
You open back a box, change it, close it, re-stamp it => it ID changed ! (now think about the children)
- you boxed a sensible information
- interactiv mode
- ammend
- squash

---
# `git log --graph --oneline --all` or `tig`
Show you the complete graph of your commits

very usefull when you are lost

---
# `git blame`
![](git.blame.jpg)

---
# `git revert`

---
# `git merge`
Someone also work on your project and want to give it changes to you
